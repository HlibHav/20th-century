models of scientific understanding unprecedented scopes of warfare new modes of communication that would operate at nearly instant speeds and new forms of art and entertainment Population growth was also unprecedented3 as the century started with around 16 billion people and ended with around 62 billion4The 20th century was dominated by significant geopolitical events that reshaped the political and social structure of the globe World War I the Spanish flu pandemic World War II and the Cold War Unprecedented advances in science and technology defined the century including the advent of nuclear weapons and nuclear power space exploration the shift from analog to digital computing and the continuing advancement of transportation including powered flight and the automobile The Earths sixth mass extinction event the Holocene extinction continued and human conservation efforts increasedMajor themes of the century included decolonization nationalism globalization and new forms of intergovernmental organizations Democracy spread and women were given the right to vote in many countries in the world Cultural homogenization began through developments in emerging transportation and information and communications technology with popular music and other influences of Western culture international corporations and what is arguably a truly global economy by the end of the 20th century Poverty was reduced and the century saw rising standards of living world population growth awareness of environmental degradation and ecological extinction56 Automobiles airplanes and home appliances became common and video and audio recording saw mass adoption These developments were made possible by the exploitation of fossil fuel resources which offered energy in an easily portable form but also caused concern about pollution and longterm impact on the environment Humans started to explore space taking their first footsteps on the Moon Great advances in electricity generation and telecommunications allowed for nearinstantaneous worldwide communication ultimately leading to the Internet Meanwhile advances in medical technology resulted in the neareradication and eradication of many infectious diseases as well as opening the avenue of biological genetic engineering Scientific discoveries such as the theory of relativity and quantum physics profoundly changed the foundational models of physical science forcing scientists to realize that the universe is more complex than previously believed and dashing the hopes or fears at the end of the 19th century that the last few details of scientific knowledge were about to be filled inSummaryAt the beginning of the period the British Empire is the worlds most powerful nation7 having acted as the worlds policeman for the past centuryWorld powers and empires in 1914 just before the First World WarTechnological advancements during World War I changed the way war is fought as new inventions such as tanks chemical weapons and aircraft modified tactics and strategy After more than four years of trench warfare in Western Europe and up to 17 million dead the powers that had formed the Triple Entente France Britain and Russia later replaced by the United States and joined by Italy and Romania emerged victorious over the Central Powers Germany AustriaHungary the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria In addition to annexing many of the colonial possessions of the vanquished states the Triple Entente exacted punitive restitution payments from them plunging Germany in particular into economic depression The AustroHungarian and Ottoman empires were dismantled at the wars conclusion The Russian Revolution resulted in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime of Nicholas II and the onset of the Russian Civil War The victorious Bolsheviks then established the Soviet Union the worlds first communist stateFascism a movement which grew out of postwar angst and which accelerated during the Great Depression of the 1930s gained momentum in Italy Germany and Spain in the 1920s and 1930s culminating in World War II sparked by Nazi Germanys aggressive expansion at the expense of its neighbors Meanwhile Japan had rapidly transformed itself into a technologically advanced industrial power and along with Germany and Italy formed the Axis powers Japans military expansionism in East Asia and the Pacific Ocean brought it into conflict with the United States culminating in a surprise attack which drew the US into World War IIAfter some years of dramatic military success Germany is defeated in 1945 having been invaded by the Soviet Union and Poland from the East and by the United States the United Kingdom Canada and France from the West After the victory of the Allies in Europe the war in Asia ended with the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan by the US the first nation to develop nuclear weapons and the only one to use them in warfare In total World War II left some 60 million people deadThe mushroom cloud of the detonation of Little Boy the first nuclear attack in history on 6 August 1945 over Hiroshima igniting the nuclear age with the international security dominating thread of mutual assured destruction in the latter half of the 20th centuryFollowing World War II the United Nations successor to the League of Nations is established as an international forum in which the worlds nations could discuss issues diplomatically It enacted resolutions on such topics as the conduct of warfare environmental protection international sovereignty and human rights Peacekeeping forces consisting of troops provided by various countries with various United Nations and other aid agencies helped to relieve famine disease and poverty and to suppress some local armed conflicts Europe slowly united economically and in some ways politically to form the European Union which consisted of 15 European countries by the end of the 20th centuryAfter the war Germany is occupied and divided between the Western powers and the Soviet Union East Germany and the rest of Eastern Europe became Soviet puppet states under communist rule Western Europe is rebuilt with the aid of the American Marshall Plan resulting in a major postwar economic boom and many of the affected nations became close allies of the United StatesWith the Axis defeated and Britain and France rebuilding the United States and the Soviet Union were left standing as the worlds only superpowers Allies during the war they soon became hostile to one another as their competing ideologies of communism and democratic capitalism proliferated in Europe which became divided by the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall They formed competing military alliances NATO and the Warsaw Pact which engaged in a decadeslong standoff known as the Cold War The period is marked by a new arms race as the USSR became the second nation to develop nuclear weapons which were produced by both sides in sufficient numbers to end most human life on the planet had a largescale nuclear exchange ever occurred Mutually assured destruction is credited by many historians as having prevented such an exchange each side being unable to strike first at the other without ensuring an equally devastating retaliatory strike Unable to engage one another directly the conflict played out in a series of proxy wars around the worldparticularly in China Korea Cuba Vietnam and Afghanistanas the USSR sought to export communism while the US attempted to contain it The technological competition between the two sides led to substantial investment in research and development which produced innovations that reached far beyond the battlefield such as space exploration and the InternetThe international community grew in the second half of the century significantly due to a new wave of decolonization particularly in Africa Most of the newly independent states were grouped together with many other so called developing countries Developing countries gained attention particularly due to rapid population growth leading to a record world population of nearly 7 billion people by the end of the centuryIn the latter half of the century most of the Europeancolonized world in Africa and Asia gained independence in a process of decolonization Meanwhile globalization opened the door for several nations to exert a strong influence over many world affairs The USs global military presence spread American culture around the world with the advent of the Hollywood motion picture industry and Broadway jazz rock music and pop music fast food and hippy counterculture hiphop house music and disco as well as street style all of which came to be identified with the concepts of popular culture and youth culture8910 After the Soviet Union collapsed under internal pressure in 1991 most of the communist governments it had supported around the world were dismantledwith the notable exceptions of China North Korea Cuba Vietnam and Laosfollowed by difficult transitions into market economies11Nature of innovation and changeDue to continuing industrialization and expanding trade many significant changes of the century were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature Inventions such as the light bulb the automobile mechanical computers and the telephone in the late 19th century followed by supertankers airliners motorways radio communication and broadcasting television digital computers air conditioning antibiotics nuclear power frozen food microcomputers the Internet and the World Wide Web and mobile telephones affected peoples quality of life across the developed world The quantity of goods consumed by the average person expanded massively Scientific research engineering

movement leader Washington August 1963Starting from the century strong discrimination based on race and sex is significant in most societies Although the Atlantic slave trade had ended in the 19th century movements for equality for nonwhite people in the whitedominated societies of North America Europe and South Africa continued By the end of the 20th century in many parts of the world women had the same legal rights as men and racism had come to be seen as unacceptable a sentiment often backed up by legislation12 When the Republic of India is constituted the disadvantaged classes of the caste system in India became entitled to affirmative action benefits in education employment and governmentAttitudes toward premarital sex changed rapidly in many societies during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s Attitudes towards homosexuality also began to change in the later part of the century1314Trauma brought on by events like World War I and World War II with their military death tolls alone at bare minimum being 29697963 and the Spanish Flu whose death count alone exceeded that helped make society in many countries more egalitarian and less neglectful of the

spread Malaria and other diseases affected large populations Millions were infected with HIV the virus which causes AIDS The virus is becoming an epidemic in southern AfricaBased on research done by climate scientists the majority of the scientific community consider that in the long term environmental problems pose a serious threat16 One argument is that of global warming occurring due to humancaused emission of greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels17 This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign the Kyoto treaty which set mandatory

randomized blinded clinical trials became a powerful tool for testing new medicinesAntibiotics drastically reduced mortality from bacterial diseasesA vaccine is developed for polio ending a worldwide epidemic Effective vaccines were also developed for a number of other serious infectious diseases including influenza diphtheria pertussis whooping cough tetanus measles mumps rubella German measles chickenpox hepatitis A and hepatitis BEpidemiology and vaccination led to the eradication of the smallpox virus in humansXrays became a powerful diagnostic tool for a wide spectrum of diseases from bone fractures to cancer In the 1960s computerized tomography is invented Other important diagnostic tools developed were sonography and magnetic resonance imagingDevelopment of vitamins virtually eliminated scurvy and other vitamindeficiency diseases from industrialized societiesNew psychiatric drugs were developed These include antipsychotics for treating hallucinations and delusions and antidepressants for treating depressionThe role of tobacco smoking in the causation of cancer and other diseases is proven during the 1950s see British Doctors StudyNew methods for cancer treatment including chemotherapy radiation therapy and immunotherapy were developed As a result cancer could often be cured or placed in remissionThe development of blood typing and blood banking made blood transfusion safe and widely availableThe invention and development of immunosuppressive drugs and tissue typing made organ and tissue transplantation a clinical realityNew methods for heart surgery were developed including pacemakers and artificial heartsCocaine and heroin were widely illegalized after being found to be addictive and destructive Psychoactive drugs such as LSD and MDMA were discovered and subsequently prohibited in many countries Prohibition of drugs caused a growth in the black market drug industry and expanded enforcement led to a larger prison population in some countries49Contraceptive drugs were developed which reduced population growth rates in industrialized countries as well as decreased the taboo of premarital sex throughout many western countriesThe development of medical insulin during the 1920s helped raise the life expectancy of diabetics to three times of what it had been earlierVaccines hygiene and clean water improved health and decreased mortality rates especially among infants and the youngNotable diseasesAn influenza pandemic Spanish Flu killed anywhere from 17 to 100 million people between 1918 and 1919A new viral disease called the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV arose in Africa and subsequently killed millions of people throughout the world HIV leads to a syndrome called Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or AIDS Treatments for HIV remained inaccessible to many people living with AIDS and HIV in developing countries and a cure has yet to be discoveredBecause of increased life spans the prevalence of cancer Alzheimers disease Parkinsons disease and other diseases of old age increased slightlyChanges in food production along with sedentary lifestyles due to laborsaving devices and the increase in home entertainment contributed to an epidemic of obesity at first in the rich countries but by the end of the 20th century spreading to the developing worldEnergy and the environmentOil field in California 1938 The first modern oil well is drilled in 1848 by Russian engineer FN Semyonov on the Apsheron Peninsula northeast of BakuFossil fuels and nuclear power were the dominant forms of energy sourcesWidespread use of petroleum in industryboth as a chemical precursor to plastics and as a fuel for the automobile and airplaneled to the geopolitical importance of petroleum resources The Middle East home to many of the worlds oil deposits became a center of geopolitical and military tension throughout the latter half of the century For example oil is a factor in Japans decision to go to war against the United States in 1941 and the oil cartel OPEC used an oil embargo of sorts in the wake of the Yom Kippur War in the 1970sThe increase in fossil fuel consumption also fueled a major scientific controversy over its effect on air pollution global warming and global climate changePesticides herbicides and other toxic chemicals accumulated in the environment including in the bodies of humans and other animalsPopulation growth and worldwide deforestation diminished the quality of the environmentIn the last third of the century concern about humankinds impact on the Earths environment made environmentalism popular In many countries especially in Europe the movement is channeled into politics through Green parties Increasing awareness of global warming began in the 1980s commencing decades of social and political debateEngineering and technologyFirst flight of the Wright brothers Wright Flyer on December 17 1903 in Kitty Hawk North Carolina Orville piloting with Wilbur running at wingtipOne of the prominent traits of the 20th century is the dramatic growth of technology Organized research and practice of science led to advancement in the fields of communication electronics engineering travel medicine and warBasic home appliances including washing machines clothes dryers furnaces exercise machines dishwashers refrigerators freezers electric stoves and vacuum cleaners became popular from the 1920s through the 1950s Radios were popularized as a form of entertainment during the 1920s followed by television during the 1950sThe first airplane the Wright Flyer is flown in 1903 With the engineering of the faster jet engine in the 1940s mass air travel became commercially viableThe assembly line made mass production of the automobile viable By the end of the 20th century billions of people had automobiles for personal transportation The combination of the automobile motor boats and air travel allowed for unprecedented personal mobility In western nations motor vehicle accidents became the greatest cause of death for young people However expansion of divided highways reduced the death rateThe triode tube is invented laying the foundation for amplification and switching technologies that led to siliconbased solidstate transistors which revolutionized modern electronicsAir conditioning of buildings became commonNew materials most notably stainless steel Velcro silicone teflon and plastics such as polystyrene PVC polyethylene and nylon came into widespread use for many various applications These materials typically have tremendous performance gains in strength temperature chemical resistance or mechanical properties over those known prior to the 20th centuryAluminum became an inexpensive metal and became second only to iron in useThousands of chemicals were developed for industrial processing and home useDigital computers came into use they greatly increased productivity and paved the way for the Internet which revolutionized global communication and information sharingSpace explorationPhoto of American astronaut Buzz Aldrin during the first moonwalk in 1969 taken by Neil Armstrong The relatively young aerospace engineering industries rapidly grew in the 66 years after the Wright brothers first flightThe Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union gave a peaceful outlet to the political and military tensions of the Cold War leading to the first human spaceflight with the Soviet Unions Vostok 1 mission in 1961 and mans first landing on another worldthe Moonwith Americas Apollo 11 mission in 1969 Later the first space station is launched by the Soviet space program The United States developed the first reusable spacecraft system with the Space Shuttle program first launched in 1981 As the century ended a permanent crewed presence in space is being founded with the ongoing construction of the International Space StationIn addition to human spaceflight uncrewed space probes became a practical and relatively inexpensive form of exploration The first orbiting space probe Sputnik 1 is launched by the Soviet Union in 1957 Over time a massive system of artificial satellites is placed into orbit around Earth These satellites greatly advanced navigation communications military intelligence geology climate and numerous other fields Also by the end of the 20th century uncrewed probes had visited or flown by the Moon Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and various asteroids and comets with Voyager 1 being the farthest manufactured object from Earth at 235 billion kilometers away from Earth as of 6 September 2022 and together with Voyager 2 both carrying The Voyager Golden Record containing sounds music and greetings in 55 languages as well as 116 images of nature human advancement space and societyThe Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990 greatly expanded our understanding of the Universe and brought brilliant images to TV and computer screens around the worldThe Global Positioning System a series of satellites that allow landbased receivers to determine their exact location is developed and deployed50ReligionSee also List
